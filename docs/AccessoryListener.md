## AccessoryListener Interface

The `AccessoryListener` interface is designed to handle various events related to the state of an `Accessory` device. This interface provides methods for monitoring connection changes, service discovery, and failure states. It is typically implemented by applications that interact with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices, like hearing aids.

### Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `deviceDidUpdate(Accessory device, int state)` | Notifies the application when the device's state changes. The `state` parameter represents the new state of the device. |
| `deviceDidDiscoverServices(Accessory device, List<AccessoryService> services)` | Notifies the application when the device has discovered available services. The `services` parameter provides a list of discovered `AccessoryService` objects. |
| `deviceDidConnect(Accessory device)` | Notifies the application when the device has successfully connected. |
| `deviceDidDisconnect(Accessory device)` | Notifies the application when the device has been disconnected. |
| `deviceDidFailToConnect(Accessory device, int errorCode)` | Notifies the application when the device connection attempt has failed. The `errorCode` parameter provides the failure error code. |
